# Preface
Whilst reading you might encounter certain terms like IP, GP and S3, these refer to the terms Individual Project, Group Project and Semester 3 respectively. I'll start with showing all products I made this semester and then we'll go into the researches I did. Keep in mind that a lot of my IP gets explained in my application's documentation. Usually I refer to the documentation but just to be sure, I've added it down here. Same goes for the GP. Nothing else to add, have fun reading.

# Products
This semester I had to realise all the learning outcomes of semester 3. Per product I will explain how I realised the corresponding learning outcome. Here's a list with all the learning outcomes. I'll also include a list of requirements I have to realise this semester in my individual project.

# Reverse Hangman Online
Reverse Hangman Online is a game I made for my individual project. I will explain per learning outcome how I realised it with my individual project. Everything about Reverse Hangman Online itself can be found in its documentation.

[Reverse Hangman Online Documentation](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre)

# Learning Outcome 1: Web Application (IP)
*You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications.*

Clarification:

**User friendly**: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

**Full-stack**: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (JavaScript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

## Front-end (RHO)
In this section I'll show some parts of my frontend, the bigger milestones. The front-end has been made in React-TypeScript. You can check the code in my repository.

[Reverse Hangman Online Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-frontend)

### TypeScript
Making a start with React TypeScript was very hard, without any experience I hopped in VScode and tried to do anything. This didn't work out at all. Everything I tried failed. My classmate Mike van den Hoef was always willing to help me but still, It wouldn't work out this way. I decided to plan a TypeScript spike. In this spike I gathered information from the W3schools TypeScript tutorial and at the same time I practised everything I was learning in a test project.

### React
I also planned a React spike, same concept as above, I just try to gather as much information about React and try to implement it. I really like this type of learning and it always works out for me. For React I used the [W3schools React tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/default.asp). In my opinion W3schools has the best tutorials to learn the basics.

### Text Input
It was surprisingly hard to get the text input value and put it in a variable for the first time. I managed to do this with a variable called word. This updates every time the text input changes. the variable basically represents live what's in the text input. Also did I have a second variable, called permission. if you click the button, permission becomes true, because the word gets permission to be checked on existence, get it? I've put the code down here so you can try to understand what Iâ€™ve done (I've left out parts of code that make it more complicated and are irrelevant for this topic).

*part of [singleplayer.tsx](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-frontend/blob/f2870b7617e50c506adc7046fd8fcfd63dbf2874/src/components/singleplayer/singleplayer.tsx#L59)*
```ts
// start game
useEffect(() => {
    if (word.length > 3 && permission) {
        const GetFromBackend = async () => {
            setLives(await GetLives(word));
            setGoal(await GetGoal(word));
            setGuessline(await GetGuessLine(word));
        };
        if (notInitialRender3.current) {
            GetFromBackend();
            setVisibilityClass('not-hidden')
        }
        else {
            notInitialRender3.current = true;
        }
    }
}, [gameStarted, word, permission])

// this happens everytime text input gets updated
function OnChange(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setWord(e.currentTarget.value);
}

function OnCLick(e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>) {
    setButtonClicks(buttonClicks + 1);
    setPermission(true);
}
```

### API Requests
This was hard to get into, even when I did a request once. It stayed hard for a while. After doing it a few times API requests became a breeze. Here are some API request examples, these are the ones used in the code above.

*part of [api.tsx](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-frontend/blob/master/src/components/api/api.tsx)*
```ts
const REVERSE_HANGMAN_BACKEND_ONLINE_PORT: string = "7071";

export const GetLives = async (word: string) => {
    console.log("word: " + word);
    const apiUrl = "https://localhost:" + REVERSE_HANGMAN_BACKEND_ONLINE_PORT + "/Lives?word=" + word;
    const data = await fetch(apiUrl);
    const jsonData = await data.json();
    return await (jsonData)
};

export const GetGoal = async (word: string) => {
    console.log("word: " + word);
    const apiUrl = "https://localhost:" + REVERSE_HANGMAN_BACKEND_ONLINE_PORT + "/Goal?word=" + word;
    const data = await fetch(apiUrl);
    const jsonData = await data.json();
    return await (jsonData)
};

export const GetGuessLine = async (word: string) => {
    console.log("word: " + word);
    const apiUrl = "https://localhost:" + REVERSE_HANGMAN_BACKEND_ONLINE_PORT + "/GuessLine?word=" + word;
    const data = await fetch(apiUrl);
    const jsonData = await data.json(); // Error
    return await (jsonData)
};
```

## Back-end (RHO)
Just like the front-end section, I'll show some of the milestones, more noticeable events that occurred in my backend. The back-end has partially been made in C# .NET and partially in Java Spring. You can check the code in my repositories.

[Reverse Hangman Online Backend Repository](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-backend)

[Game Statistics Service Repository](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/Game-Statistics-Service)

[Word Service Repository](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/Word-Service)

### External API
I've heard of it so many times, yet did I never use it. External API's, had 0 experience going into this. As you should already know, I'm making a hangman-like game. Since there will be words in my game, they should get checked on existence. To check a word on existence I've build a process in my word-service. So my backend does an API request to Merriam-Webster (dictionary API I use). If the word exists, Merriam-Webster returns me values, so now you would say, if the API returns anything it's good right? WRONG, this is where it gets interesting. Merriam-Websters dictionary API uses fuzzy search, this means that if I do an API request with the word 'Birate'. It will return me lots of different words that are almost the same as 'Birate', for example 'Pirate'. See example.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174489523-7a7b9d36-4929-4357-a894-9d594fd76ecf.png)

To solve this problem I found a solution. If I do a request of the word 'Pirate', this is the JSON result I get.

```json
[
   {
      "meta":{
         "id":"pirate",
         "uuid":"02589eac-2077-4abd-abfe-1d72ad856773",
         "sort":"1600684000",
         "src":"sd2",
         "section":"alpha",
         "stems":[
            "pirate",
            "pirates",
            "piratical",
            "piratically"
         ],
         "offensive":false
      },
      "hwi":{
         "hw":"pi*rate",
         "prs":[
            {
               "mw":"\u02c8p\u012b-r\u0259t",
               "sound":{
                  "audio":"pirate01"
               }
            }
         ]
      },
      "fl":"noun",
      "def":[
         {
            "sseq":[
               [
                  [
                     "sense",
                     {
                        "dt":[
                           [
                              "text",
                              "{bc}a robber of ships at sea {bc}a person who commits piracy"
                           ]
                        ]
                     }
                  ]
               ]
            ]
         }
      ],
      "shortdef":[
         "a robber of ships at sea : a person who commits piracy"
      ]
   }
]
```

Important to note is that `meta.id` contains the word I did a request for. So the only thing I got to do is, check if `meta.id` equals the word I did a request for. Here's my code for it. As you see I've put it in a try catch, since the JSON object isn't guaranteed to have data for `meta.id`. Because as you saw in the 'Birate' request we didn't have `meta` nor did we have `id`. This is the way I filter words that don't exist.

*Part of [WordResource.java](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/Word-Service/blob/1d19e80132950c192d5cdc68a4d6a404f9fe74f1/src/main/java/EpicChainsawMassacre/reversehangmanonlinebackend/resources/WordResource.java#L66)*
```java
String wordString;
try {
    wordString = json.getJSONObject(0).getJSONObject("meta").getString("id");
}
catch (Exception e) {
    return false;
}
```

### Reverse Hangman Forms Copy Paste
So as you might know, I made an application in WinForms called ReverseHangmanDesktop. Since all the logic in ReverseHangmanDesktop was coded separately from the presentation layer, I could just copy paste all the logic from that application into my application. My application did become an absolute mess. But I got all the backend functionalities in only a few minutes. Otherwise it would probably take hours.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173446686-4a8d6a00-e537-4be5-9aee-1028e6214576.png)

### Communicate with Front-end
Communicating with the frontend was a mystery at the start, I looked op tutorials how you make a C# service that can talk with a React frontend. It looked all super vague to me, I even tried to build a controller in WinForms haha don't do that. I did manage to call API requests from a WinForms application, that was actually pretty funny. But I was wasting time. Finally I went in Visual Studio and wrote API ASP.NET something like that. I clicked the one with ASP.NET Core. It was all a very random process. Maybe I also used a guide I can't remember it too well. But when I got in the project I got an auto-generated example with `WeatherForecast` that returned an array with some extra's. I just simplified that auto-generated endpoint and created the following.

*part of [Program.cs](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-backend/blob/7d29db75f1619feae6fbcd069dc75f676db0a3f4/Reverse-Hangman-Online-Backend/Program.cs#L63)*
```cs
app.MapGet("/Lives", ([FromUri] string word) =>
{
    gameSetup.differentLettersInWord = WordClass.CountDifferentLetters(word);
    gameSetup.game.teamCollection.GetTeamList()[0].CalculateLives(gameSetup.differentLettersInWord);
    return gameSetup.game.teamCollection.GetTeamList()[0].Lives;
}).WithName("GetLives");

app.MapGet("/Goal", ([FromUri] string word) =>
{
    int goal = gameSetup.game.teamCollection.GetTeamList()[0].GuessCollection.CalculateGoal(gameSetup.differentLettersInWord);
    return goal;
}).WithName("GetGoal");

app.MapGet("/GuessLine", ([FromUri] string word) =>
{
    gameSetup.game.SetWord(word);
    string guessline = gameSetup.game._wordClass.CalculateWordStripes();
    return guessline.Length / 2;
}).WithName("GuessLine");
```

My frontend just gives the word to an endpoint, the endpoint does some calculations with the word and returns for example the amount of lives it should return.

## Future Plans
My future plans are to finish a working round in Reverse Hangman Online. Right now you can only fill in a word, and make it check on existence. Further on do the lives and goal get calculated depending on the word.

Also do I still want to save game results to a database. Right now nothing with a database happens. Also would I like to show data from my database in the frontend. Further on I was planning to make songs for my game. I really looked forward to do that. Also adding sound effects, it brings the game overall more alive. At last I also wanted to add different languages, for this project I was planning on making English and Dutch. By changing the language, not only the UI should change but also the checking of words, so that means I would probably have to use a Dutch dictionary API. Finally I wanted to add a ranking system to my game. people would be able to create an account and have an amount of rank points, Elo. This Elo would make people play against others from the same skill level.

*Example of how I want to show data in my frontend*

## UX-Testing
My project wasn't finished yet. So I couldn't let someone test my application. I asked my teacher for solutions, and he told me I could make wireframes and test the experience on users using my wireframes. I could also step it up and make a prototype of my application, and let users test my prototype, focussing on the process and gameplay over the looks and design, because in the end its just a prototype. You know where this is going. Last semester I made an application called Reverse Hangman Desktop. Reverse Hangman Desktop is a prototype-ish application I made in WinForms. My entire individual project is based on the prototype-ish application. So my prototype application would be perfect for UX-testing.

### Moderated User Testing
For my project I did a moderated user test. This means I let someone play through my application, whilst spectating. If my user had any questions about the application he could ask me. The more questions he would ask the more I should update. Let's actually look like what happened during the test, and how it went.

### Jay Tests my Application
Some guy I found at school called Jay was willing to test my prototype application. By forehand I told Jay that anything he could mention anything that looked off. Having that said we started actually testing the game. We would play against each other. We would choose team names and start playing. I had to start choosing a word, and he had to start guessing. In this playthrough I chose the word 'Dongel' (Dutch word for Dongle). Here you see an image of Jay guessing the word.

*Image of Jay thinking*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173931794-31c3b963-ad19-4f3b-8b9e-c9e2eeab4c5a.png)

*Oopsie, the letter 'N' is in the word*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173931980-02e6dea7-a4a4-448f-aed8-fc7ea124742b.png)

Jay completed the first round with a good olâ€™ clean sweep, gaining 2 points. Now it was his turn choosing a word.

*Jay typing a word :0*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173932093-a16db979-9ddb-4ec2-be3d-a80356c06c82.png)

Now it was my turn to guess the word, I failed and got 0 points. 

### Feedback from Jay
After our quick playthrough I asked Jay for feedback about the application, things he liked, things he didn't like. He responded with the following. 'App werkt naar behoren' meaning, the app works like how it should work. He also said 'duidelijk maken dat je het verkloot hebt', meaning he wants it to be more clear when he made a mistake. Right now you lose a life, the letters shows, and you hear a fart sound effect. But I might reconsider how to show you made a mistake. 'instructies zijn duidelijk' this means he says the instructions are clear. Here's an example of an in-game construction.

*In the red square you see a instruction*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173932899-68e3a1e4-c588-4fcd-974b-212580a01e16.png)

A mistake I already made in the UX-Test is that I took a user that has already played it before on a whiteboard. So he did already know the basics of the game. Another thing he said was 'makkelijk te spelen', meaning itâ€™s easy to play. And the last thing he said, was how he like that the players can define the difficulty. If players are up for a real challenge they can choose harder words. In his words 'limiet ligt bij de gebruiker, je kan zelf bepalen hoe makkelijk of hoe moeilijk je het maakt'.

### What now?
What do I do now? Do I adjust everything Jay said? No. I first want to do more UX-tests targeting different people, like different age, gender and culture. I think I might get more feedback like that. My idea is to apply the feedback I get multiple times of multiple people. If multiple people give me the same feedback itâ€™s enough validation for me to update the game.

## Object Relational Mapping
In our GP we used an ORM for our menu-service. In our service we've created entities. With some annotations and configuration we set up that the entities we've created get created in a MySQL database. Here is an example of what an entity class looks like.

[Product.java](https://github.com/fontys-group3/Menu-Service/blob/master/src/main/java/groep3/test/entities/Product.java)
```java
@Entity
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Product {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)

    public long ID;

    public String name;

    public String image;

    public double price;

    public long categoryID;

    public long stock;
}
```

This is what it looks like in MySQL if we run the application.

As you saw there's already data in it, we've done this by adding a data.sql file. In the red square you can see the lines of code that generate our data.

[Reverse Hangman Online Documentation - Architecture](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre#architecture)


# Learning Outcome 2: Software Quality
*You use software **tooling and methodology** that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.*

Clarification:

**Tooling and methodology**: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

## Testing
In this semester I have to make use of 4 types of tests, unit, integration, regression and system tests. If i have a good explanation for it I may decide to not use certain types of tests.

### Unit Testing 
In a unit test you test a single unit. The meaning of a unit is very vague on the internet. Some say it's a function, some say itâ€™s a class, and some say itâ€™s a service. Since I use a microservice architecture, I would say a unit test tests a single service. Having that said let's look at my unit tests.

I didn't make too many unit tests. This is because I donâ€™t have that many logic in my application. My application consists mainly of services talking to each other, so the integration tests will be more interesting.

#### Unit testing Reverse-Hangman-Online-Backend with NUnit
First of all, I will show the two unit tests in my backend. For these tests I used the NUnit testing framework. I didn't really think before choosing honestly, I just casually wrote a test with the framework I used in semester 2. But here is the first test. This test tests if the goal in the game gets calculated right. Since the formula I used to calculate the goal is complicated, I've put a comment above the test explaining the test. Also can you see I used a parameterized test. This way I can test even and odd numbers with the same test, since the formula works differently on even and odd numbers.


*[GoalTest.cs](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-backend/blob/master/Test/GoalTest.cs)*
```cs 
public class GoalTest

    }  

``` 

In the next test I calculate the amount of lives the player should have. It is very similar to the first test. A formula calculates the amount of lives and the formula is explained above the test. Again, I used a parameterized test, this way I can test multiple test cases.

#### Unit testing Word-Service with junit 
In my API wrapper (word-service) I wrote a test to test the functionality of Bucket4j. I used the junit testing library for testing in Java. Again I didnâ€™t really realize the choice of my testing libraries were all that important. The purpose in this test is to see if I understand how to use Bucket4j. After I understood how Bucket4j worked, I created a rate limit for the Merriam-Webster external dictionary API.

*part of [ReverseHangmanOnlineBackendApplicationTests.java](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/Word-Service/blob/1d19e80132950c192d5cdc68a4d6a404f9fe74f1/src/test/java/EpicChainsawMassacre/reversehangmanonlinebackend/ReverseHangmanOnlineBackendApplicationTests.java#L30)*
```java  
 
@Test 
void apiBucket(){ 
   // so every minute you can use 5 tokens 
   Refill refill = Refill.intervally(5, Duration.ofMinutes(1)); 
   // there are 5 tokens in total? 
   Bandwidth limit = Bandwidth.classic(5, refill); 
   // Build the bucket 
   Bucket bucket = Bucket4j.builder() 
         .addLimit(limit) 
         .build(); 
 
   // consume all 5 tokens 
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { 
      assertTrue(bucket.tryConsume(1)); 
   } 
   // should be no tokens left 
   assertFalse(bucket.tryConsume(1)); 
}  

``` 

In my frontend I haven't written any unit tests, since my frontend only shows values on the page that get calculated by other services. I could test for example that it shows `REVERSE HANGMAN` in my menu screen, but if the project build successfully this already guaranteeâ€™s the page loads correctly, so no need in my opinion. In my Game-Statistics-Service nothing happens, the project is pretty much blank.

### Integration Testing
An integration test, tests multiple units. From my understanding, since I use a microservice architecture, this means I test multiple micro services together.

#### Integration testing Word-Service and External API with junit
Here's the integration test in my word-service. Again a parameterized test since this just saves writing multiple tests that lookalike. I have 2 testcases. First I test a word that actually exists `help`, so it should output `true`. Next I input a non-existing word `asgfkjas`, this should output `false`. The test speaks pretty much for itself. We test the method `wordExists()` to test if a word exists. `wordExists()` makes use of the external Merriam-Webster dictionary API. So the end, we test the communication between my service and the external service. 

*part of [ReverseHangmanOnlineBackendApplicationTests.java](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/Word-Service/blob/1d19e80132950c192d5cdc68a4d6a404f9fe74f1/src/test/java/EpicChainsawMassacre/reversehangmanonlinebackend/ReverseHangmanOnlineBackendApplicationTests.java#L22), Integration Test with external API*
```java 

@ParameterizedTest 
@CsvSource({"help,true", "ksgujfudg,false"}) 
//@ValueSource(strings = {"help", "asgfkjas"}, booleans = {true, false}) 
void checkWordExistance(String word, Boolean exists) { 
   WordResource wordResource = new WordResource(); 
   assertTrue(wordResource.wordExists(word) == exists); 
}  
```
*part of [WordResource.java](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/Word-Service/blob/1d19e80132950c192d5cdc68a4d6a404f9fe74f1/src/main/java/EpicChainsawMassacre/reversehangmanonlinebackend/resources/WordResource.java#L61), method that gets used in integration test*
```java
    public boolean wordExists(String word){
            RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
            String jsonResult = restTemplate.getForObject("https://dictionaryapi.com/api/v3/references/sd2/json/" + word + System.getenv("API_KEY"), String.class);
            JSONArray json = new JSONArray(jsonResult);
            System.out.println("Result: " + jsonResult);
            String wordString;
            try {
                wordString = json.getJSONObject(0).getJSONObject("meta").getString("id");
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                return false;
            }
            System.out.println("Result2: " + wordString);
            if (wordString.contains(":")) {
                wordString = wordString.substring(0, wordString.length() - 2);
            }
            System.out.println("Result3: " + wordString);
            return wordString.contains(word);
    }
```

#### Integration testing Reverse-Hangman-Online-Frontend and Word-Service with jest-dom
Next up the integration tests in my frontend. In my frontend I used the jest-dom testing library. I choose this library because we also used it in our group project. This was a fatal choice, you'll read in a bit why *(Exiting)*. I'll mention a few things about my tests first, `CheckWord()` is the API request to my API wrapper (word-service). You can find this method underneath the test code block. I send a word to word-service, word-service checks the word at external API, gets something back, and sends it back to the frontend. Few important things to mention, To execute this test, the external API and my word-service both have to be running. Since the external API runs 24/7 I didn't mention it in the comment above the test. 

Another thing, as you might know, I built an API rate limit for the external API, this rate limit sits at 1 request per 5 seconds for more details about the rate limit, I added it below the `CheckWord()` code block. You might see the problem, I do 2 tests rapidly after each other, so how can I prevent hitting this API rate limit? I did this by putting delay in my test. `jest.setTimeout(10000)` means the max amount of milliseconds a test gets, so if the test takes longer than 10 seconds it stops. with `await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000));` I make a request that takes 5000 milliseconds, this way the tests prevents hitting my own rate limit.

*[word-service.test.tsx](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-frontend/blob/master/src/test/word-service.test.tsx)*
```ts
import "@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect";
import { useState } from "react";
import { CheckWord } from "../components/api/api";
import { Word } from "../interfaces/interfaces";

// Prerequisite: For this test the word-service has to be running
test("Check Word (Doesn't Exists)", async () => {
    // Arrange
    let word: string = "charmander";
    let wordObject: Word;

    // Act
    wordObject = await CheckWord(word);
    console.log(wordObject);

    // Assert
    expect(wordObject?.exists).toEqual(false);
});

// Prerequisite: For this test the word-service has to be running
// jest.setTimout increases the max time a test can use before exceeding the limit
jest.setTimeout(10000);
test("Check Word (Exists)", async () => {
    // Arrange
    let word: string = "help";
    let wordObject: Word;

    // Act
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000));
    wordObject = await CheckWord(word);
    console.log(wordObject);

    // Assert
    expect(wordObject?.exists).toEqual(true);
});
```

*`CheckWord()` from [api.tsx](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-frontend/blob/f2870b7617e50c506adc7046fd8fcfd63dbf2874/src/components/api/api.tsx#L4)*

    const data = await fetch(apiUrl);
    const jsonData = await data.json();
    return await jsonData
};
```

*here you see the rate limit I build for the external API in seconds, hours and days. part of [WordResource.java](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/Word-Service/blob/1d19e80132950c192d5cdc68a4d6a404f9fe74f1/src/main/java/EpicChainsawMassacre/reversehangmanonlinebackend/resources/WordResource.java#L21)*

            .addLimit(limitHours)
            .addLimit(limitDays)
            .build();
```

#### Integration testing Reverse-Hangman-Online-Frontend and Reverse-Hangman-Online-Backend with jest-dom
I also tried to write tests for the connection between my frontend and backend. For some reason, this was the only thing I kept testing myself by starting up my application, so unlike the other tests, this test has been made after the functionality already worked. But still, in the end it's useful, because if I'm able to test it with some code, I donâ€™t have to run my app 1000 times a day and test it myself.

In the following test I want to test if my frontend correctly gets the goal from the backend. I do that with 3 separate tests. I don't use parameterized tests since jest-dom doesn't support parameterized testing. Also doesn't jest-*dom* support disabling CORS policy, this makes the entire test useless. This was a very good lesson for me to make a thoughtful choice when choosing a testing library.

*[GetGoal.tsx](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre/reverse-hangman-online-frontend/blob/master/src/test/rho-backend/GetGoal.tsx), this test should actually be named `GetGoal.test.tsx` but since it doesn't work I had to remove it from my tests*
```ts
// JEST-DOM DOESN'T SUPPORT DISABLING CORS POLICY, THEREFORE THESE TESTS ARE USELESS FOR NOW

// Prerequisite: For this test reverse-hangman-online-backend has to be running
test("Get Goal (even: 4))", async () => {
    // Arrange
    let word: string = "help";
    let goal: string;

    // Act
    goal = await GetGoal(word);

    // Assert
    expect(goal).toEqual("8");
});

// Prerequisite: For this test reverse-hangman-online-backend has to be running
test("Get Goal (odd: 5))", async () => {
    // Arrange
    let word: string = "horse";
    let goal: number;

    // Act
    goal = await GetGoal(word);

    // Assert
    expect(goal).toEqual(10);
});

// Prerequisite: For this test reverse-hangman-online-backend has to be running
test("Get Goal (even: 6))", async () => {
    // Arrange
    let word: string = "clover";
    let goal: number;

    // Act
    goal = await GetGoal(word);

    // Assert
    expect(goal).toEqual(12);
});
```

### Regression Testing
As regression testing, I test all my unit tests where I specifically test logic. For example, I test the way lives get calculated every time I pull request to master. In my continuous integration pipelines I don't only build my application, but I also test them. I've added links to all my CI/CD pipelines so you can check them out yourself. Here's one of my pipelines, somewhere in the middle I have an action named `Test` that's where the tests happen.

### System Testing
In a system test you test a walkthrough from one point to another. For example, in my web game that would be from start page, to playing a full round of the game. Or from start of the game to the rules section. Or from the rules section all the way to play a full round of the game. This concept I just explained also goes as End-to-End testing.

#### End-to-End Testing
In my current application end-to-end testing could be very interesting. Why you would ask? Well, basically my entire project consists of user inputs. The user chooses what word to guess and the user chooses a letter to guess. Further on in the game, the user has to choose if he wants to gamble his points for double or nothing. After a full round of playing, the Game-Statistics-Service should save all the results to the database. Since the user can choose the word they want and guess any letter in any order, there can be many different outcomes. It takes a while to test this all myself. Especially if I have to do this multiple times. Sadly it's not possible yet to play a full round in my game, neither does the saving to a database work. Therefore I can't build the test yet.

I did prepare by writing out the end-to-end scenarios I want to test. You can find them back here.

## Static Code Analysis
For code analysis Iâ€™ve made use of SonarCloud. I chose SonarCloud since a classmate of mine told me it is pretty easy to setup via SonarCloud. After a pull request to master, the SonarCloud code analysis get executed. Using code analysis I can easily find vulnerabilities in my code.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173247608-e802e311-4316-4a2a-96d0-318d8b2dcf75.png)

### Code Smells
Currently SonarCloud doesn't detect any bugs or vulnerabilities in my services, except the backend. It also detects a few code smells.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174443500-266b7595-c670-4e03-a0cb-f43086a77162.png)

The backend bug is no surprise. It refers to that I have multiple classes in a namespace, and honestly the entire code is such a mess so no surprise.

*Backend bug*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174443627-3353b6e2-4191-4770-ba13-0aa3a11f37b8.png)

*Frontend code smells*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173247849-7599d782-7d60-4b1e-808f-4ed045f2dfbc.png)

My goal with SonarCloud is to review the code smells and bugs, and fix them. If SonarCloud notifies me that there are problems I will solve them first before merging my pull request.

## Code Reviews
Inside the group project we didn't have structured moment where we would review each others' code. We have done [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) often online and on location. When Pair Programming, one person codes and the others observes it, giving real time feedback. Here are some code review examples. 

### Coding language
One of our group members was coding in Dutch while the others were programming in English, so we told him it would be better if he also coded in English. 

### API requests 
Another example is that one of my group members advised me to pull out all API requests out of the code, and put it in a separate file. This way the API requests are all together and is it easier to find them and edit them.

### Classes vs Functions
Also did my classmate multiple times tell me I should use classes over functions in React-TypeScript, and I kept telling him he should use functions over classes, but neither of us had a good argumentation why. 

So in the end, we had some forms of code reviews but we didn't take code reviews too seriously.

# Learning Outcome 4: CI/CD
*You **design and implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.*

Clarification:

**Design and implement**: You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

## Continuous Integration
I've setup continuous integration pipelines in all my applications. The pipelines build the application and run all the tests I've written, except for reverse-hangman-online-frontend. This service doesn't get tested automatically. The reason for that is because there are only integration tests in the frontend that depend on my backend or word service. I can't test these automatically since my service has to be running. I did all of this using the GitHub actions section. GitHub actions provides lots of templates which make it very easy to setup a pipeline. For my front-end, back-end, game-statistics-service and word-service I used a Node.js, .NET template another .NET template and a Java maven template respectively. 

Here's an example where the pipeline actually helped me improve my code. I kept getting build errors, but my project itself would run normally so without the pipeline I wouldnâ€™t notice the errors. I did get a few messages in my IDE but I always ignored them, I only started to notice the IDE errors when they were gone.

## Continuous Deployment
I also added Continuous Delivery to all of my repositories. This means that, after a pull request on the master everything gets deployed on docker hub. In Docker desktop, if I go to remote repositories, I can indeed see that the images have been pushed to docker hub.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173250305-8d6d2b01-faec-4ed3-bb0f-29a94ca0c52b.png)

But huge issue, they weren't getting deployed. To deploy all my applications I copy pasted the Docker file of a classmate of mine. This made 2/5 images actually run, but 3/5 weren't running. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174109810-dde544a6-52ed-4f4e-a856-3ec8ac65bd68.png)

To fix this I probably have to change something in my docker file, one issue, since I copy pasted everything, I have no idea what's happening. I know why it stop's running. But I don't know how to fix it. So I decided to put a hard focus on learning docker.

### Learning Docker
To learn docker I followed the tutorial on Docker's website. After learning the basics about docker, I wanted to focus on my actual problem. I didn't know how to setup a docker file. I tried looking up tutorials but everyone just breezes through the docker file without explaining it. Then I realized something. The docker error I got was always exactly the same. No matter what I did. If my docker file looked like the following
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS runtime
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["GameStatisticsService/GameStatisticsService.csproj", "GameStatisticsService/"]
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "GameStatisticsService.dll"]
```
or if it looked like this
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0-focal AS build
WORKDIR /source
COPY . .
RUN dotnet restore "./GameStatisticsService/GameStatisticsService.csproj" --disable-parallel
RUN dotnet publish "./GameStatisticsService/GameStatisticsService.csproj" -c release -o /app --no-restore

# Run
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0-focal
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./

ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "GameStatisticsService.dll"] 
```
I got the same error. That made me realize, I wasnâ€™t updating my local docker images. everything kept getting pushed to docker hub, but if I ran them locally I kept running the 4 line docker file. Once I realized that everything was pretty easy to setup. Just look up for docker files, copy paste, and everything runs in a compose file.

Everything runs, great, but the api requests between my applications don't work. My frontend can't seem to reach my backend and vice versa. To fix this I will configure them on the same IP.)


# Learning Outcome 6: Design
*You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using **multiple types of test techniques**.*

I've split this learning outcome into 2 parts. In this section I'll focus more on the design. If you are looking for the requirements part of this learning outcome, have a look at the GP version of this learning outcome.

[Learning Outcome 6: Requirements](#learning-outcome-6-requirements)

## Architecture
Looking for architecture? Click on the link below.

[Reverse Hangman Online Documentation - Architecture](https://github.com/Epic-Chainsaw-Massacre#architecture)

## Design Origin
At first glance it all might looked like I was building a random interface and hoping for the best. Actually what I was doing all this time is trying to recreate my application I made earlier, ReverseHangmanDesktop. This is was ReverseHangmanDesktop looks like (if you've read Reverse Hangman Online Documentation this might look familiar).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173570455-621c2a54-a43f-4498-80e6-6f570801afb1.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173570820-9ee24450-4e26-46ab-9e69-7cb9e7e419ea.png)

### Comic Sans MS
But how did I come up with this design you're asking? As you might know, Comic Sans MS is the real meme font. ReverseHangmanDesktop itself was a meme that slowly became reality. So I wanted to make the application for a big meme. This also perfectly fits that it has been made in WinForms.

### Black and White
The colours black and white haven't been chosen randomly. I wanted to create a page that gives a 'grim ominous' vibe. I'm not sure if thatâ€™s the correct words I'm trying to say 'een kille en nare vibe'. Having a black screen gives this dead and cold vibe. For a long time I was also looking for scary fonts like these.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173572160-33f7eccf-f126-4236-8559-78cf226fd0b8.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173572196-314fc5da-5216-4b9b-951a-0f81fb178c52.png)

But usually they costed money or I didn't like them, after like 30 minutes of searching for a good font I just decided to roll with the meme.

### User Interface
For the UI I just wanted to keep it simple and clean. I don't want people to stare all day to the screen trying to understand what it all says. That's why I tried to structure the app. Down below you can again see ReverseHangmanDesktop.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173572547-f1828901-a42d-4e0b-82f7-2724134b4567.png)

The idea is again to replicate this onto my project. Currently it looks like this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173572977-84aa2916-a58a-4712-bd0e-58bf1c2bd9b6.png)

I also still wanted to make a background looking something like the image down below. This also adds up to the spooky vibe of the application. Here are some sketches, this is NOT how the application looks like now. just ideas.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173578807-efd02e2c-b314-4269-b9e9-e2da0d06e798.png)

# Learning Outcome 8: Professional (IP)
*You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.*

Clarification:

**Professional manner**: You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

## Feedback
This semester started off with the teacher [Leon van Bokhorst](https://github.com/leonvanbokhorst). I asked him weekly feedback, sadly you won't be able to find it all back in my FeedPulse PDF Report, since sometimes my teacher forgot to open a feedpulse session. Leon has motivated me a lot throughout the semester, and definitely turned this boring documentation focussed semester into a fun semester. Later in the semester, the last 3 weeks, I got 2 new teachers, [Jean-Paul Ligthart](https://github.com/jpligthart) and [Timo Hermans](https://github.com/timohermans). I also tried to speak both of them once a week.

# Restaurant Ordering System
The Restaurant Ordering System was my group project this semester. I made it together with [Mike van den Hoef](https://github.com/Headoros), [Tim Meijvogel](https://github.com/Timsel1), [Cas Esselink](https://github.com/CasEsselink) and [David Chang](https://github.com/Davidchang24). Everything about our Group Project can be found at its documentation

[Restaurant Ordering System Documentation](https://github.com/fontys-group3)

# Learning Outcome 1: Web Application (GP)
*You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications.*

Clarification:

**User friendly**: You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

**Full-stack**: You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (JavaScript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

## Front-end (ROS)
The front-ends have been mainly made by Me, Mike, Tim and David. We coded it in React-TypeScript. Me and David worked on the same repo, Tim had its own and Mike also had its own. We had different repositories since we used a microservice structure.

## Back-end (ROS)
The application has multiple backends. The backends have been made by Me, Mike, David and Cas. The only language we used in our backend is Java. Me and David worked on the same backend. After a while when me and David got some processes working between the front-end and back-end, we decided that I would mainly focus on the front-end and he would focus on the back-end, since it was pretty annoying to both work on both. But on the other hand, since we've setup everything together we both exactly knew how each otherâ€™s application worked. This came in pretty handy, since David decided to stop in the middle of the semester. Because I knew how the backend worked this didnâ€™t affect our group project.

## My Tasks
I'll slowly take you through everything I was responsible for.

### Menu Logic
Me and David have worked on everything behind the scenes of our menu. We came across such a hard problem that I couldn't even describe it to look it up. I also couldn't do it in C#. I was completely lost, since usually, logic wise, nothing is impossible to me in C#. The problem we had was sorting our products into categories. So that all deserts get sorted together, all main dishes would get sorted together etcetera. In the end of the day Mike or David solved it somehow. Pretty funny, I found the message back where I'm saying "_design is going good but I have no idea how to get them sorted right_".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173420101-f96a85ce-5683-4cd9-a557-19a143107225.png)

### Menu Design
As you just saw, I alo worked on the design but only in the first sprint. The menu looked a bit prototype-ish, so Mike gave it a big make over. Here is the old design I made in sprint 1.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173419259-bc31c838-1cdb-48e7-b750-2cf27c51535b.png)

### Inventory
My latest task was about making the inventory in our menu. I made the inventory so that when you click on a product, it check in the database how much there's left for that item. If there's more than 0 left, one gets removed from the database. Why do we use a database for this you'd ask? Since you can also save everything on the page. We used to save in on the page, but the problem then was that it wouldn't share data between different clients. If a product is out of stock it gets greyed out like down below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173433824-06d00ee3-5066-4b5b-b48a-bf28efb75f90.png)

# Learning Outcome 3: Agile Method
*You can implement the software process for your project according to a given agile software development method.*

Clarification:

**Agile** method: You are aware of most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. You are able to implement the process of your software project according to a chosen methodology.

## Scrum
For our group project we used the agile method scrum. We chose Scrum after the result of a research one of our group members did, sadly he stopped and I can't find it back. In our project we have one scrum master every sprint. The scrum master would lead the stand-ups and standdowns. Furthermore, the scrum master role in our project didn't have too much meaning to it. For example, usually the contact person in the group is the scrum master. But we found it easier to make that role static and give it to a group member (me). It kind of felt like we were all the scrum master, this way of working didn't really give any problems.

I did a small research to the other agile methods, I did this by searching multiple resources online. Usually about 3 to 6 websites.

## Kanban
I'll go briefly through the practises of the Kanban methodology. 

### Visualize your work
When starting a Kanban project itâ€™s important to visualize your work in a Kanban board. Kanban boards can look very differently, in the image below you see the most basic example.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173593181-bc1769a5-fd60-4637-94d6-afcce31bfab1.png)

Some people tend to add extra tabs to it, or make it their own. That's all depending on your group.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173593650-26a8a1b3-d3a0-4df8-a903-176a243b90cd.png)

### Limit Work in Progress
This basically means as a group you set a limit to the 'in progress' tab. I took the example I just showed and drew a red line at the bottom of the in progress tab. This way the work-in-progress tab stays clean. The work-in-progress limit depends on how big your group is. For example if you have a group of five people you want to have around 6/10 tasks.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173594939-4a81c8eb-25bc-40ed-a2c3-3610b2294112.png)

### Manage Flow
Through the process you check how your requirements go through the Kanban board. If there are requirements stuck on in progress for a while you might reconsider if the requirement is setup right.

### Define when a requirement is done
When working on a requirement you might just keep going on forever not knowing when to stop. That's why you should add definition-of-doneâ€™s to your requirements. This way you can check you checklist and know when a requirement is done.

### Apply Feedback
It's important to ask and apply feedback within the group, within the group members and also with the product owner. You can setup feedback loops, for example every Monday, where you discuss a list of things, or for example do code reviews.

### Improvement
It's important to keep improving throughout the process. You don't just make you're requirements, setup the board and just work till then end. Whenever you can improve something in the project, itâ€™s important to improve it.

## Extreme Programming
Extreme programming, also known as XP, exists of short development cycles wherein you define the requirements and assign them. Itâ€™s as if, if you compare it to Scrum, you set up a sprint right before it starts. Just like any other agile methodology, XP comes with some practises, 12 to be exact. Since 12 is quite a lot we'll split them in 4 groups.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173691785-a12e36de-e21f-44d2-8e9a-b12ff6729b6e.png)

### Fine-scale feedback
Pair programming is one of the practises. Pair Programming is when 2 people team up on one device. One of the 2 writes the code also called the 'Driver' while the other observes the code also called 'observer' or 'navigator'. The goal is that the observer gives feedback to the driver. Usually the roles get switched frequently. Another practise is the planning, you should plan together with the product owners when which products should be released, also should you guys as a team plan who works on what and when. In the second phase the product owner isn't evolved. Writing tests is also a practise pretty straight forward, write tests for your code. At last the product owner should always be contactable for feedback during the working process.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173691621-c0645897-1322-4b2e-b1f2-c3feff1aca6d.png)

### Continuous process
in this section falls the practise to have everyone code on the same shared space and merge the code several times a day. Refactoring is also a part of all this. This means you improve the code without adding or removing functionality. As last itâ€™s important to have releases throughout the project. Small releases so that the product owner knows the current state of the project. Itâ€™s also important that the code isnâ€™t from someone, the code is from the entire team. Everyone is allowed to make changes to the code. Everything should be written as simple as possible, if you have a functionality with 100 lines of code that could be written in 60 lines of code, you should shorten it. As last itâ€™s important that everyone can read the code, including people that don't code. You can achieve this be giving everything names that explain themselves as good as possible, for example good variable names, good class names, good method names and comments where necessary.

### Shared understanding
Use the same coding standards for example code in the same language like Dutch, English, German, Iâ€™m not talking about same coding language, although that would also be pretty important if you work on the same piece lol. For another example letâ€™s look at C#, itâ€™s pretty well known in C# that you do pascal casing on methods and start private fields with an underscore.

### Programmer welfare
itâ€™s important that the developers donâ€™t work more than 40 hours a week. If there happens to be overtime one week it doesnâ€™t mean you can skip the overtime you did in the next week. Because XP consists of small processes. If you donâ€™t work for a while you can miss a lot since the processes are so small.

## Waterfall
Just like lots of other agile methodologies, waterfall exists of making requirements, design (models), implementation, verification or testing and deployment and maintenance in this order. I'll explain them all briefly.

*Waterfall methodology flows down in this image like a waterfall :0*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173694949-4fab62c2-e7b1-46c5-a530-468a542b244f.png)

### Requirements
In waterfall it's important to have all your requirements defined at the start. Also is it important to plan how long everything will take so you can tell the customer the costs by forehand.

### Design Models
With design we aren't talking about the user interface, but stuff like class diagrams architecture models flow of the app stuff like that. After you've made these you can move on to the next part

*Example of a flow diagram, a flow diagram is one of the many diagrams that could be made in the design process*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173695265-858682df-bfa9-49dc-b5a2-0c57abe7b740.png)

### implementation
In this phase the team codes the application. They write code based of the requirements.

### Verification
Here the team tests their code to see if it does satisfy the requirements.

### Deployment and Maintenance
After deploying the project, the team should maintain the project. If any bug/issue gets found, they solve it.

# Learning Outcome 5: Cultural Differences and Ethics
*You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.*

Clarification:

**Recognize**:  Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

**Take into account**: Adapt your communication, working, and behaviour styles to work with other developers from different cultures; 
Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  

## Cultural Differences
For this section I will answer 5 questions.

### What is culture? 
Culture is shortly, activities, behaviour and practises of a group. For example the Dutch are very direct. Itâ€™s important to take this into account, since usually they don't try to be mean but it sounds like they try to be mean a lot. but thatâ€™s just how they are. Another example of culture is that the Turkish people organize a big party if they marry.

### Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences? 
the 4 dimensions are power distance (PDI), individualism (IDV), uncertainty avoidance (UAI) and masculinity (MAS). I'll describe them down here.

#### Power Distance (PDI)
Power distance is the degree a society accept or rejects unequal power distribution. For example in the Netherlands everyone behaves another equally. But for example in Japan they show lots of respect for older people, people with a higher status and people with titles. You can already see how this could go wrong. If a young Dutch direct developer, and an older Japanese developer work together. The Dutch might behave unrespect full in the eyes of the Japanese man. This is why itâ€™s important to understand each otherâ€™s culture. 

*In this image you see the differences between Japanase bows, these get mixed up a lot. Usually people think there is just one bow, but there are multiple.*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173791109-7a9a2b23-c718-443a-9434-920864cb93a3.png)

#### Individualism (IDV)
Individualism is the degree a human prioritizes his own, induvial accomplishments. the counterpart is collectivism, this is that you care more about the group accomplishments

#### Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI)
Uncertainty Avoidance is the degree a society tolerates risks. An example of a country with a high uncertainty avoidance culture is France. this means that if you have a French worker in your group, he will expect structure and predictability to possible risks.

#### Masculinity-Femininity (MAS)
Masculinity-Femininity is the degree a society values assertiveness and materialism versus feelings, relationships, and quality of life. I found an interesting table where they put masculinity against feminity. This table explains it better than me so have a look.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173784309-b9497c83-48c9-418b-9be4-d79cdc288d2c.png)

#### Can you give examples for cultural differences that you have experienced in your study or life? How do you explain these differences?
Actually, no. I have never really experienced these cultural differences at work nor did I experience them at school. This is probably because Iâ€™m very integrated in the Dutch culture. The only really difference I noticed that I take into account, is that sometimes I find people annoying and they get on my nerves. But I try to ignore it and respect them since they can't do a thing about it. And till now itâ€™s going pretty good, but that's not a cultural difference.

#### What is your culture?
My culture in short consists of a few practises and norms. Every Friday I try to go to the mosque for my religion. I have respect for everyone, doesn't matter if itâ€™s a kid that's 4 years old or an elder, I threat them both the same most respectful way I can. Justice is something I find very important, threat others with justice. Threat others like you want to be threated, thatâ€™s like one of the most important sentence in life for me. I like a good structure, Iâ€™m usually good at planning. I donâ€™t like it if thereâ€™s no structure. I can tell more and give more examples, but everything I want to write down ends up with 'threat others like you want to be threated'. for example, if I donâ€™t help my sis with moving out. I wouldn't expect her to help me moving out. And at last parents come before anything.

#### What did you  do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
Since I canâ€™t give examples in the group project I will take examples of real life. If I see a family member I always try to start the conversation by saying 'salaam wa alaikum'. Itâ€™s just a respectful way to greet Muslims. If someone says it to you, you respond with 'Wa alaykumu s-salam'. A huge cultural difference I'm confronted with in the Netherlands is going out to party and drinking beer and all that. I don't drink, I have no interest in it and its also forbidden in my religion. going out to a club looks very wrong to me so I always pass. Just the stories you hear the videos you see. To me it all feels very wrong and it doesnâ€™t fit into my culture.

## Ethics
I've split this section up in 7 questions.

### What is ethics in software engineering?
Ethics is software engineering mean that, engineers should think about the consequences of their product. They should avoid giving a group of people bad consequences.

### Why is ethics important in software engineering? 
Over the years the impact of software on our lives has grown on an insane level. everywhere around you is software. Engineers should take ethics into account, because they could mess up people their lives. How you would ask? For example letâ€™s look at factories. Over the years more and more processes in factories got automized. This resulted in people losing their jobs. Losing your job unexpectedly as an adult could be very fatal since you have lots of charges you got to pay, and as an adult itâ€™s not always easy to find a job.

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 
As a software engineer you should inform your product owner about the negative aspects/consequences of your work.

### How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 
To understand other engineers their view, everyone can share their view and opinions about ethics and the ethical consequences of the project.

### Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? + Do you foresee ethical conflicts caused by your software? What kind of?  
In our group project the biggest ethical aspect is the following. We take a process that gets executed by humans, waiters to be more specific. Waiters wander around and take orders from the customers, they bring the order to the kitchen, and finally they serve out the food. So actually a waiter has 3 tasks. Letâ€™s we build an application for a restaurant where they have 3 waiters. each waiter has its own task. one waiter gets orders, one brings orders to the kitchen, and one serves out the food. If the fictional restaurant I just described uses our application it would have the following results. 2 out of 3 waiters would be unnecessary. since the orders get taken automatically, and the orders get to the kitchen automatically. this means only the food has to get served out. ethically this is a bad application for the waiter since it creates a decent chance of them losing their job.

### Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts? 
We could build the application slightly different, so that the customers donâ€™t use the app but the waiters use the app. In our fictional restaurant app it saves one waiters  job. But in the end we build the application to automize the process. What's the use in having the waiters do a task with our application, if you can also give it in the hands of the customers. This is a dilemma you can think about for quite a while. for example, does the product owner just want to get rid of the employees to save money? will he use the employees for something different. This ethical problem summons lots of questions. So yes you could avoid the conflict by giving waiters another task in the restaurant or building the app in a way that they have to use it. Or you minimize it by keeping a part automized and a part not automized. But how useful is that really.

*image of a waiter using our application to take an order*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173804913-5b326448-4a96-43f9-9d47-b3c44deb10eb.png)

## Coding Together
We didn't have very strict coding standards in our team. We did have one rule and that is to code everything in English.

If multiple people worked on one repository we made branches and push the branches to GitHub. finally we merge them to the master. Working like this we avoid pushing our code to the master branch which could be very fatal.

# Learning Outcome 6: Requirements
*You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using **multiple types of test techniques**.*

Clarification:

**Multiple types of test techniques**: You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

## Quality Requirements
Before we started coding, we showed our user stories to the stakeholders. When they agreed to the user stories we started working on them. In a sprint delivery we didn't only deliver all our products but also did we show our stakeholder which user stories we would work on next sprint. This is very good to do since if they don't like a part of a user story or the priority of a user story they tell it us. Sadly we don't have footage of the stakeholders giving us feedback, but we do have the minutes of every meeting. Here are some example of feedback we wrote down during meetings/sprint deliveries.

In blue you can see their feedback on all our user stories. Since it's a lot I'll translate a few. *add the user story that adds the functionality to place an order*, *user story 12 'actions' isn't clear for us, and what do you guys consider as a mistake?*, *in lots of user stories you guys use the format 'As a User ... because ...' , you guys can leave away the 'because' if it's not necessary.*

In blue it says, *It's not important to focus on the paying process*, underneath the blue sentence they gave us advice on functionalities they would like to see instead, for example, *Make it impossible for outsiders to reach our website*, *saving a session to the backend*, *show all orders in the management portal* and *completing an order*.

## User Stories and Non-Functional Requirements
We kept track of all our user stories and non-functional requirements using Jira. Here are all our user stories and non-functional requirements. User stories are green, non-functional requirements are blue.

## Security and Performance
We had a few security issues in our project. For example, its possible to place an order, eat your food, remove your cookies on the browser. and it doesn't say you have to pay anymore. Our solution for this would be to save the cookies in the backend. At this moment we only save it in the frontend. Another security flaw is that it's possible to place an order while you aren't even near the restaurant. We wanted to solve this problem by making it impossible to reach the URL if you are on a different IP, but that required WI-FI. And using a restaurant WI-FI isn't the most user friendly solution. so for this flaw we didn't find an solution yet. Sadly we ran out of time to build the functionalities.

## Technical Decisions and Architecture
For our technical decisions and architecture I strongly recommend to visit our applications documentation.

# Learning Outcome 7: Business processes
*You can explain **simple** business processes and **relate** them to the development of your software project.*

Clarification:

**Simple**: predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.

**Relate**: understanding the relationships between the process and software.

## Ordering Process
In our business process we visualized the entire process of making an order digital and analog. You see 3 phases in this process, these are placing the order, prepare the order and finishing the order. Let's go through 2 quick examples. 

### Non-Digital
John enters the restaurant and takes a seat. Now the ordering process takes place. In the order process John orders a burger and a coke. The waiter writes it all down and brings the order to the kitchen and bar. This is where the preparing phase starts. The kitchen makes a burger and the bar prepares a coke. When everything is prepared, the waiter takes it to John's table. If John is done dining, the ending phase starts. In this phase the cashier types in the amount of money John has to pay. John pays for the food. If John gave too much money he gets his change from the cashier. Now the cashier asks John if he wants the receipt. John decides he wants the receipt, and leaves the restaurant.

### Digital
John enters the restaurant and takes a seat and scans the QR code to open up the menu. Here the process of ordering will start. John clicks on a burger and a coke, and places the order. Now the preparing phase starts. Kitchen and bar employee claim the burger and the coke in their interface respectively. When both are ready to serve, they drag the order to done in their interface. Then the waiter gets the order and serves it out to John. If John is done eating, the ending phase starts. He gets an invoice to his phone, after paying he can choose if he wants the receipt and he's free to go.

### Key Differences
Let's go through the biggest differences between non-digital and digital together. 

### Ordering
When ordering non-digital the waiter can accidentally write down an order wrong just because he misunderstood the customer. When done digitally, the customer chooses what he wants to eat using software. Before ordering you can double check everything what you've selected. After placing the order the waiter brings it to the kitchen and bar, this could also go wrong in multiple ways. The waiter might have to help a customer on its way to the kitchen or the bar. also can he mix up what has to go to the bar and what has to go to the kitchen. Digitally this all goes automatic.

### Preparing the order
In an non-digital situation, the order comes in and the employee takes the order and prepares it. This is very similar to how it would go digitally. When using our software you replace the paper with technology.

### Payment
In an non-digital situation you have to go to the checkout. Here they get your bill, and type it in on the cash register. Digitally you can just stay on your place, pay and leave. The cashier could possibly give you the wrong bill giving a bad customer experience. When paying digital, this can't occur.

*Business process for making an order*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173024638-a51d2346-4b31-43a5-b7ad-1ce023b01e67.png)


# Learning Outcome 8: Professional (GP)
*You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.*

Clarification:

**Professional manner**: You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed software methodology and following team agreements. You are able to track your work progress and communicate your progress with the team. You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions. You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

## Team Communication
Inside our group we used Teams and Discord to communicate. We started off in Teams, but after a while we only used the Teams for files and we permanently switched to Discord. In our group project we had a set of rules about presence.

*Rules of Presence*
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172949644-04301849-de14-4ae8-b7b8-f988d8f2ef1b.png)

For the English readers, this says. *Be present at 09:00, after 09:10 you will be considered as late. If you know you will be late let us know 1 day before. If you don't let us know anything, you are late and you don't have a valid reason to be late, we give you a strike. All the rules that apply to being too late also apply to not showing up at all. If you get you're third strike we inform the teacher about your presence.

Always if I knew I would be late I let my group know but to prove it here are some messages of me letting my group know I will be too late.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172952242-3fc00baa-3ed7-4e82-8ae6-3f1f81da832b.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172952188-a35c89c3-2e90-468e-9be0-0e4e525bf3b3.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172952157-a3bf6c8e-2f65-412a-8499-e911c2bad0e0.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172952128-d5dea735-1c1e-4233-a8c6-55e5a5ed2a42.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172952108-61ab7cb4-30cf-45f9-82ee-94bb2c2578d0.png)

Again for the English readers, these are just messages like, *I will be x minutes later, I got to go to the family doctor, I had a bloody nose so I will be later.*

## Communication with the Stakeholders
Not only is the communication in our group solid, but also the communication between us and the stakeholders. As soon as something unexpected happens we've let them know, for example. When a group member decided to stop we've let them know as soon as possible and also sent them the current state of our user stories.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172954296-68a9f5d1-df14-4668-9c32-50241f31f021.png)

## What are the others doing?
On our Jira board I could always see what the others were doing for the project. In the following picture I can see that Cas is currently working on 2 user stories and Tim is working on a task. Mike isn't assigned to an user story or task yet. I assume he finished his most recent user story recently. Since everyone is always working on something.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172953466-a102c551-0f8c-4077-8ba9-071b1cd4685b.png)

## Ask for feedback
After every sprint delivery we got feedback from the stakeholders and from the teacher. But this is only once every 3 weeks. We also often mailed our stakeholders to ask for feedback on user stories we were still working on. Here follows some proof.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/172954438-de04f77b-ffb3-468c-ad17-51a4dbe20fcc.png)

# Side Projects
In this section I will mention the side projects I made this semester that were bigger than my usual side project. I added these projects because I enjoyed making them and I think they deserve a spot in my semester summary. This also shows that I don't only work professional for a school project, but also in my spare time.

## Auto Clicker
Auto Clicker is by far the most useful application I have ever created. This semester I often played a braindead game called Mutants: Genetic Gladiators. inside of this game there was a place where you could farm resources if you clicked on certain places in a certain order. I used to repeat this process of clicking as a kid over 1000 times. A few semesters ago, I used a random auto clicker I found on internet. This semester, I wanted to farm the resources again, but I refused to download an auto clicker online. I am an experience WinForms developer, if there's anything I should be able to make, it's an auto clicker in WinForms.

*Video of me setting up the Auto Clicker, and farming resources on that stupid pay to win game*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174418294-6f732cbd-bfcd-4dbf-8d57-15f8e9d1c958.mp4

Here's the documentation, it explains how to use the Auto Clicker.

## BattleSim
BattleSim is a project I started all the way in semester 1. In semester 1 I hardly made a working project, In semester 2 I refactored everything. It was semester 1 code, so there was lots of unnecessary code that could be written shorter and more efficient. In semester 2 I wanted to create a functionality that both players can choose their fighter. Since that wasn't possible, you would get assigned a fighter based on player 1 or 2. It first looked impossible, but I told myself, I'm in semester 3 software. How the fuck can I not make a simple battle simulation. With some help of The Coding Den I got it working. Also did I add another fighter. I'll show a before and after.

*Semester 2 BattleSim*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174434335-d5760f7c-11b8-4f0c-bf9e-7b3ad73e015e.mp4

*Semester 3 BattleSim, still working on it (I am currently showing the create-abilites branch)*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174434117-c3e4e20b-d2b3-49ed-9ff9-91bd53ed498e.mp4

The hard thing I did to make choosing your own fighter possible, is making use of override methods. I can't just call the method of a child class from the base class. Here is the code that made it possible to override child classes their methods over the base classes their methods.

*part of [NeoFigther.cs](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/BattleSim/blob/4137a43cfe3dcd59abff1c677d4b00b13275fbf4/BattleSim/Logic/NeoFighter.cs#L53), the base class*

```cs
    abstract public class NeoFighter
    {
        abstract public int Attack1(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter);
        abstract public int Attack2(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter);
        abstract public int Attack3(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter);
    }
```

*[Blumaroo.cs](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/BattleSim/blob/create-abilities/BattleSim/Logic/NeoFighters/Blumaroo.cs), child class, still in developement*
```cs
public class Blumaroo : NeoFighter
    {
        public Blumaroo()
        {
            Name = NeoFighterNames.Blumaroo;
            Health = 300;
            AttackPower = 29;
            CritRatio = 10;
        }

        public override int Attack1(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter)
        {
            //wooden fist
            //10% to increase attackPower by 1
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
        public override int Attack2(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter)
        {
            //mimic
            //learn enemies' last used move
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
        public override int Attack3(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter)
        {
            //ingrain
            //heal 10 health every turn for 3 turns
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
    }
```

*[Korbat.cs](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/BattleSim/blob/create-abilities/BattleSim/Logic/NeoFighters/Korbat.cs), done for now*
```cs
public class Korbat : NeoFighter
    {
        NeoFighterNames _name = NeoFighterNames.Korbat;
        int _health = 280;
        int _attackPower = 28; // this means between 26-30
        int _critRatio = 15;
        int _chanceToPoison = 45;

        public Korbat()
        {
            Name = _name;
            Health = _health;
            AttackPower = _attackPower;
            CritRatio = _critRatio;
            Attack1Name = "LifeSteal";
            Attack2Name = "Strychine";
            Attack3Name = "PoisonBite";
        }

        public override int Attack1(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter)
        {
            //LifeSteal
            //heal 40% of dealth damage
            int damage = Attack(rnd, _attackPower);
            GainHealth(damage * 40 / 100);
            return damage;
        }
        public override int Attack2(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter)
        {
            //Strychine
            //double damage if enemy is poisoned
            int damage = Attack(rnd, _attackPower);
            if (enemyNeoFighter.IsPoisoned)
            {
                damage *= 2;
            }
            return damage;
        }
        public override int Attack3(Random rnd, NeoFighter enemyNeoFighter)
        {
            //PoisonBite
            //30% chance to poison
            int poisonChance = rnd.Next(1, 101);
            if (poisonChance <= _chanceToPoison)
            {
                enemyNeoFighter.SetPoisoned(true);
            }
            return Attack(rnd, _attackPower);
        }
    }
```
For more information check the documentation, you can also take a look at the code.

## Ranknir
Ranknir is a discord bot I made for fun. The discord I made it for showed a list of players in a certain clan and their rank points. The thing that bugged me was, they only showed all players their 1v1 stats. I thought this wasn't fair for the hardcore 2v2 players so I decided to make it myself.

*The 1v1 list that already existed in the discord*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174409799-1a1b909b-1f41-48f7-b631-3a998bc491e0.png)

*The 2v2 list that I made, as you can see it fits the style of the already existing one*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174409895-5fe193b8-2532-4f58-a3d8-1e2c89a86ef1.png)


To accomplish this, I first needed an API key of the game in question, Brawlhalla. I looked up how to get an API key and it was pretty clear, you just had to mail them explaining why you want the API key and what your plans are. So I explained exactly that.

*Me asking the game people behind Brawlhalla for an API key*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174409298-7444b8fd-67bb-4f8b-a270-89bc46bf113a.png)

*Them approving the request, and giving me an API key*

The code isn't too interesting, I improved my python skills. Besides that did it give me a good practise with JSON data. I thought this was a pretty interesting project to execute, also to show in my semester summary. The entire process of mailing a popular game, them responding, all that, it was a fun and cool project. For more information check the documentation.

[Ranknir Documentation](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/Ranknir)

## Money Squadron Virus
A less interesting project I worked on this semester is Money Squadron Virus. MSV is a meme bot created in python. Other than practising python this project didn't really add up to my skills as an software engineer, but in the end I did spend quite some time on this project, maintaining it, so I thought it deserved a spot in here. 

Here are a few of my favourite memes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/174412150-4f81bda6-7937-4654-b9d2-e1a5b70b312a.png)

Every time I want to add a meme I have to edit the code, I tried to import Imgur in my python code, so that I only have to add a meme to Imgur and my application would automatically pull the image, but no success sadly. Bot was made to mock a discord server called Money Squadron. But the hype came to an end. Bot is still up though. For more information check out the documentation.

# Research

## Which database is most suitable for my application?
For this research I made use of the [DOT framework](https://ictresearchmethods.nl/The_DOT_Framework).

**What**: I want to research which database fit my application the best.

**Why**: Instead of choosing a random database, I'd like to know which database fits my application the best. Because if you realize you chose the wrong database in the middle of the project it might cost a lot of time, effort and money(for a company, I'm just a student).

**How**: Find multiple articles about how to choose the right database for your application, validate them, and use them for my research.

I've put the document with the research in it in my semester summary. Because it's so big you have to download it.

[Database Research](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/School-Semester-Summaries/tree/master/Semester%203%20-%20Software/Database%20Research)

## How do I protect the URLs my microservices use to communicate against DDoS attacks?
First I asked myself 3 questions. What do I want to research, why do I want to research it, and how do I want to research it.

**What**: I want to research how I can protect my URLs against DDoS attacks.

**Why**: If I don't protect the URLs, people can DDoS attack my services, which slow down my application or can even take it down.

**How**: Trying to understand what all the risks are of not protecting the URLs, and finding out how to protect the URLs making use of reliable sources and validation.

I've put the document with the research in it in my semester summary.

[Security Research](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/School-Semester-Summaries/tree/master/Semester%203%20-%20Software/Security%20Research)

# Reflection

## What went good?
Here I'll explain everything that went good in this semester.

### Asking feedback
This semester I tried to get at least once a week feedback. The next week I would implement the feedback, and show my implemented feedback to the teacher. The last 3 weeks we got 2 teachers instead of 1, so I tried asking both of them for feedback once a week.

### Documentation
This semester I found out documenting can be pretty fun. If you look at Reverse Hangman Online Documentation, I documented an entire game I was making. Further on I tried to add documentation to all the side projects I included to this semester summary. Also did I translate our GP decisions to English and did I wrote a documentation for the restaurant system. Also do I like my semester summary, it's a bit on the long side, but if you use the links in Table of Contents correctly you can navigate anywhere you want, and find anything you want.

### Focus on a subject
Multiple times this semester I had to work on something I had 0 experience at. For example, TypeScript, Java, React, Docker. But every time I just ignored every other aspect of my project, and focused on that one subject. This worked so good for learning anything. For example in our group project I was a total React-TypeScript noob. I spend a day learning the basics and returned pretty experienced. This focussing on a subject is also called a â€˜Spikeâ€™. My teacher Leon recommended it and it worked out really good.

### Researches
A lot went wrong in the researches but I felt like I was doing a good job, especially in the URL DDoS research. Itâ€™s straighter to the point than the database research. I'm curious what the teachers will think of it.

### Working tempo in GP
In the IP I wasn't using my weeks too efficient, this will be explained later on. But in the group project I was usually working or helping others. We also noticed that the tinier the group got, the more efficient we worked.

### Testing
Now that I think about it, I actually did write tests whenever I needed them wherever I needed them. I just didn't really focus the learning outcome. If you look at the learning outcomes, my project lacks end-to-end testing, but right now, I could make an end-to-end test, but it wouldn't help me in any way, since the functionalities I want to test in the end-to-end tests aren't there yet. I did document the scenarios I would like to test in the future.

### Presentations
Our presentations weren't always prepared, but if we prepared the presentation for the sprint delivery, we were so good. Especially the second last sprint delivery.

### Side Projects
The side projects I worked on this semester were so fun. If I find something fun, usually the result will be better than usual. Maybe I shouldâ€™ve prioritized the IP a bit more. In then end very happy about my Side Projects.

### Presence
I always have been on school when I had the opportunity, even though I concentrate better at home, I find it fun to hang around with everyone, and of course to ask feedback.

### The last 3 weeks
The last 3 weeks I worked so hard, I never took school this seriously. I just hate wasting time in general, and I know I have what it takes to pass this semester so I would freak out if working 12 hours a day on school was all for no reason.

## What will I do different next time?
Here I'll explain what I would do different the next time. Here you will find out stuff about my semester you might have never even known, pretty fun section. Enjoy.

### Planning
My planning this semester was terrible, honestly I don't know how I ended up in this state. In the final week I got my stuff back together and made a planning for myself. In the planning it says everything I still have to do/make. This is what my planning currently looks like. In the last week it really felt like all my structure I usually have come back.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74303221/173577617-be6f2748-156c-43df-9338-52afac4153c3.png)

### Research
In my database research I've done a few things I will do different next time. 

### Testing Libraries
I didn't make thoughtful choices around testing libraries for my applications. Thought it didn't really care until jest-dom screwed me over with some missing functionalities like not being able to disable CORS policy checking.

##### Filtering Sources
The way I decided which sources to use was. I looked up a source. Researched the person that wrote it. If the person was well known and had a database background I gave it a high trust level, if not I gave it a low trust level. Why won't I do this next time? If someone is well known to a lot of people and has 10 years of experience with databases, it doesn't mean he has a good understanding of databases. A better strategy would be to find multiple sources, and use the information I encounter the most. If multiple people say the same stuff it sounds more reliable to me.

##### Drop Databases for the wrong reasons
In my research I dropped a few databases for controversial reasons. I dropped a database that had extra functionalities that I didn't need. But in the and all databases have that so that was quite unnecessary. I dropped 2 database types because they donâ€™t directly support a key functionality I need. But by using a workaround I could actually make them work. As soon as I saw the key functionality was missing I instantly dropped it, but I shouldâ€™ve given it a chance to the end. This is a good way to start the next topic.

##### Random Conclusions 
I randomly had a few conclusions throughout the research. Usually you have a conclusion at the end, but I had multiple at random spots. This usually means I have researched topics inside of my research, I kept researching and researching. This blends in nicely with the next topic.

##### Kept Researching
I kept researching everything. That's not bad, but I also kept researching topics that didn't fit in my database research at all. For example I researched how reliable people are that write online guides.

##### Time
The next time I will start earlier, I kept procrastinating since I didn't know what I wanted to research, and because I found the DOT-framework very vague. In the end I started researching in the last week. This was a strange experience for me since I usually plan everything perfectly.

### UX-Tests
Do more UX-tests, start earlier, target multiple kinds of people. I let a user test my application that already had a good understanding of the game, that comes with pros and cons. Since he already knows whatâ€™s coming, he can be more critical, but because he already knows it, everything is clear to him. So UX-testing 1 person definitely won't do the job

My teacher also gave me feedback to observer my user. Try to look at his behaviour. From someone's behaviour you can also conceive information. Do confirm your conceptions with your user. Like this my UX-tests will be more efficient.

### Don't just listen/do what others say
In this semester for example, my teacher would tell me I had to create a login, importing Auth0 and all that. I had never read that anywhere on canvas, but honestly I didn't read canvas that well. Also something really stupid of me this semester. But I just accepted I had to build a login. Luckily another teacher told me it wasn't necessary. And I did a security research instead of building a login.

Also teacher A said he recommended us to learn Java, so we learn a different language. Then teacher C asked me why I decided to learn Java and my response was, 'Because the teacher recommended it'. It would've been better if I would've thought more about that decision. In the end Iâ€™m quite happy I worked with java but still. Next time just think more before instantly making a choice.

Also did I think I had to build a microservice application for my individual, but that wasn't even the case. Also kind of adds up to all this.

### Start taking GP more seriously
in semester 2 we had a really nice and kind man as product owner. It felt like he was just a classmate of us. With the same mindset I went in S3 and I felt like I was a bit too comfortable with the product owners. I started to just have a chat with them that they looked like some Dutch celebrity. But I surely wouldn't do that next time hahah.

*I showed an image of this guy to the product owner saying he looked like him*

### Bad First Impression
Our first impression with the product owners was horrible. We had to ask them question about the case they've send us. But only or two people of our group did actually read it. That was a terrible experience. At first it felt like our group tried to keep it secret, but I just told them we didn't read it at all nor had we seen it. Our teacher sent it so us over Teams so that was really on us. To do this better next time I should read Teams more frequently. But the issue with that is, I get so much garbage over teams for some reason. So maybe I should just clean that.

### Code Tools used too late
So I have to use all kinds of tools that help improve my code, for example the CI pipeline and code analysis. I added these kind of late to the project, therefore I couldnâ€™t make too good use of them.

### Resetting my school laptop 12 times
I reset my laptop I used for school a total of 12 times this semester. Why? because when I try to game, I got very little FPS stutter and this freaked me out. So always if I would play online I would reset my pc, and guess what, I played 1 hour a day. So any day my laptop felt off, I reset it. Usually I did this in the weekends what brings us to the following topic.

### Mondays
Lots of Mondays I had to reinstall everything for school. This was because I reset my laptop in the weekends due to lower performance. So usually half of my Monday was gone because I was reinstalling everything.

### Wednesday
I usually did nothing on Wednesday. This was because me and my mom watched a series that always dropped at Tuesday 23:30. The episode usually lasted like 150 minutes. so I would always sleep way too late. Since I still wanted to sleep properly I woke up pretty late. This made me tired the entire day. And then I did nothing the entire day. This is how every Wednesday went. This was very unprofessional behaviour of me.

### Thursday
On Thursdays I came to school, usually hanged around with everyone, checking on everyone how they are doing. Asked my teacher for feedback. And overall just talked a lot with people doing not too much for school, This of course changed the last 3 weeks, but as you can see I didn't do too much on Thursdays.

### Friday
Every Friday I woke up, worked a bit on school, went to the mosque, worked a bit on school and went to work. I mean, the mosque only took 1 hour, but still it felt like I did shit every Friday. Also probably because I wasn't forced to wake up early.

### Videos in Semester Summary
I just absolutely forgot this was a thing sadly, The last 3 days someone reminded me it was a thing and I added for example docker running in a video so you can see itâ€™s not fake. but other than that I wanted to focus more on finishing everything instead of taking videos of everything.

# Epilogue
In the end it was an okay semester. I've had semesters that were more fun. Everything this semester just went vague or unstructured. I didn't necessarily reached/learned cool things, neither did I make too cool things. Let's hope I don't have to do it all over again. I did have lots of fun making the side projects though.
